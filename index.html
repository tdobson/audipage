            <h1>Dear Aldi UK...</h1>
            <p class="lead">On the 8th of August, my van (number plate: OV08 UBR) stopped at Aldi Knutsford so my girlfriend could buy some reasonably priced painkillers for her knee, whilst the driver took a break from driving. </p>

            <p>Somehow, Parking Eye, an Aldi parking contractor, felt the van had overstayed its welcome, and decided they were owed £85 for the 30 minutes overcharge. That's £2.80 per minute!</p>

            <p>Giles, Dan, Matthew - This is your store, this happened on your watch - let's take all this frustration, anger, drama and tears and turn it into something positive.</p>

            <p>We all know how far £85 will go at Aldi but there are many less fortunate people who can't buy their food from you.</p>

            <p>So how about I suggest a more proportionate 'punishment'? If you donate £85's worth of food to the MidCheshire Foodbank - supporting the refugeees, and other vulnerable groups - those who need your food the most, then I will drive to your Knutsford store in our van, and personally take it to the foodbank for you!</p>

            <p>Giles, Dan, Matthew can we put this behind us, and do something good for the children who need your food most?</p>
